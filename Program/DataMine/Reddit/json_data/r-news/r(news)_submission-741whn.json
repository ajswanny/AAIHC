Make sure to check with the paramedics/emts or other rescuers WHERE to take the patients. The problem is the majority of the people taking themselves to the hospital go to the closest one, which ends up overwhelming the hospital and it's resources. So if someone needs immediate life saving interventions, it may get delayed because the nearest hospital has no resources to spare, while a hospital a bit further away may have staff twiddling their thumbs and waiting . this happened in 9/11. The biggest thing is make sure your safety is priority. You can't help others if you end up being a patient yourself\n\nSource: Paramedic \n\nEdit: I'm definitely not criticizing this persons action. This is a tip in case you find yourself in this situation. If emergency responders aren't on scene and you're ready to roll out, by all means, roll out. But, if you have the opportunity to get the information about where to take the patients, you will be doing the patient and the hospitals a favor by trying to get them somewhere where resources are available to help them quickly",

Basically it is throwing a casualty into a vehicle and to just go. This is different than a [MEDEVAC  (medical evacuation)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_evacuation); and [AE (air evacuation)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromedical_evacuation).\n\nHowever, as great as he was, he could have hindered care for more critically injured patients. (He didn't)\n\nNow, I am not saying that is what happened. He was a Marine and likely knew about [MASCALs/MCIs (Mass Casualty Incidents)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-casualty_incident) and hopefully mitigated as much as he could have (he did). But potentially, ~~he~~ (~~or~~ future copycats can bring) ~~could have brought~~ a bunch of minor casualties (minimally injured) or expectant (likely to die) to one hospital and left the immediate (life threatening) and delayed (serious but not life threatening) at the location. Some Medical professions and CERT (Community Emergency Response Team) members are trained in [triage (sorting of casualties)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_triage_and_rapid_treatment).\n\n\nThe influx of injured can cause a hospital that could have taken critical patients to either turn away more critical casualties or be distracted by all the immediate/minor patients (as they came first) and miss/delay care for the people who needed it more.\n\nIf you are in this situation. **BE SAFE. Your life is # 1.** Get yourself, loved ones or people to the left or right of you if you can. Get out of the situation until you know it is safe. If you are injured/*killed you will tie up resources and do no good for anyone.*\n\nHowever, if it is safe. Find a Medical personnel/CERT member, or even a former military (with experience) that can help take lead in this kind of event if no medical/CERT are available. Take orders from the leader of the situation. If they ask you to transport, so be it. Otherwise, you will likely be asked to provide first aid; pressure, compressions, breaths, etc\u2026\n\nTake a [first aid class]( https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&q=first+aid+course&oq=first+aid+course&gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0.0.48467.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.HqVGUvU-SoQ). From the [Redcross]( http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/first-aid-training), or the [AHA]( http://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/FindACourse/UCM_473162_Find-A-Course.jsp), [etc]( http://www.nsc.org/learn/Safety-Training/Pages/first-aid-training.aspx) \u2026Hell, join the [boyscouts]( http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/HealthandSafety/amredcross.aspx) or at least take a [online one]( http://www.firstaidforfree.com/free-first-aid-course/). These classes can save lives outside of tragedies like this weekend.\n\nBut, if you are the kind of person that would want to help further in the MASCAL/MCI but, do not want to be medical. [Become part of your local CERT community.]( https://www.ready.gov/community-emergency-response-team) You do not have to be medical. They take volunteers and for situations like what happened in Las Vegas. You will become an invaluable source and trained on how to best handle such situations.\n\nHere are some videos I have \u2018googled\u2019 online to show you an idea of what it is like (these may be outdated and wrong to follow) so at a bare minimum if you want to have an idea of what happens and what you should expect. \n\n[A more cinematic outline of what happens.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leoVtgkLYR4)\n\n[This is CERT training video outlining a more step by step processes.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUusRUsfKAA)\n\nAgain, safety first. Then, find casualties to administer first aid. Source: Former; Army Medic, CRBNE, EMT, and a current Army Nurse.\n\nEdit: Read the article.

Due to how the hospital was designed, the emergency entrance was somewhat hidden, and people experiencing very real emergencies would wander through my entrance, a considerable walk away from the ER bay.\n\nOne evening a heavily pregnant hispanic woman came up to my desk. It took about five minutes of back-and-forth between me, her five-year-old, and her, before I realized suddenly she was actively in labor. I sprinted her to the maternity ward, frantically wondering what the hell I was supposed to do if the baby popped out before then.\n\nAnother time, very late in my shift, I look up to see a 300lb man stagger through the entrance. Mind you, the welcome center plaza was enormous all on its own, and the doors were easily 20 yards/meters away from my desk, and there's nothing soft for him to collapse on between the two, and it's immediately obvious that a hard collapse was what his gameplan for the night would involve. I vaulted over the desk, flew underneath him, and was very thankful when he retained just enough consciousness to support some of his weight so I wasn't crushed. I then yelled across the lobby at my coworker, who was staring slack-jawed at the entire affair, for him to get me a wheelchair for the guy already. I magicked him off to the ER, again frantically running over in my mind how CPR worked, keeping a finger on his neck to check his pulse, making sure he kept talking to me.\n\nYeah...I honestly won't be surprised if I hear receptionists yesterday were pulled into minor things for incoming victims. When there's no one else but you, what are you supposed to do? \n\ne: I should add that, when not directing people around the hospital, or gently explaining over the phone to elderly persons that their loved one was dead without actually telling them their loved one was dead, I DID spend most of my time online, which I was explicitly not supposed to do. \n",

So that is 6-8 level 1 trauma centers within ~50 miles.\n\nSo I would probably say Boston is the likely winner with a high amount of critical and severe cases.\n\n\n\nIf it was pretty bad with A LOT of people with urgent but more minor things, then probably Houston, the Texas Medical Center is the largest in the world. It doesn't have as many level 1 trauma centers, and several facilities are highly specialized (MD Anderson for instance is entirely cancer), but what it would have is a high concentration of beds and trained people that could come and help.\n\n\nSo probably one of those two. More trauma I would say Boston wins, higher volume of people but less trauma Houston probably wins.  If it happens in reality nobody wins.",

It never stopped them from asking, confusedly, where Walter is, he was in the ICU just yesterday, can't I transfer their call to him, there's no way he would've moved hospitals, he was far too sick for that, but he was just fine the last time they visited, he was in room 15, he can't have left, can I check again? And I would, and Walter's on the discharge list, which is where everyone ends up when they leave the hospital, one way or another, and then it's just a matter of guiding them to the same conclusion I reached, without actually telling them (which would be breaking the law).

Got in an accident a couple months back for turning into a parking lot over a lane, where the other car darted from around a corner speeding at least 20 MPH over, and hit me from behind while in the middle of two lanes, and where the driver switched seats with the passenger. Turns out the car was the passengers sisters, and the guy who was driving had no licence and a previous criminal record for drugs. Even with eye witness testimonies from the local security that was nearby, my dads testimony, and mine, my insurance still went into the case as though the lady(passenger) was driving. The lady(passenger) then didn't call back my, or her insurance company for over a week, and then lied about the accident saying she was driving. She also lied saying she was in her lane, contrary to the pictures we provided showing her car after the accident in two.\n\nI ended up getting whatever \"partial\" fault is, and my insurance rose over $400 every 6 months. Regardless of the fact that the person who was \"supposedly\" driving wasn't, with multiple eyewitness reports. Regardless of the fact that the person who WAS driving had no licence. Regardless of the fact we freakin provided photo evidence she was in two lanes when she hit me. I was maybe a couple inches of my front bumper in the other lane.\n\nMoral of the story is car insurance companies are not actually there to help you. Mine screwed me over and now regardless of the fact that I'm switching, I'm going to have to pay hundreds of dollars more every 6 months to keep my insurance. I would assume regardless of this situation, this guy may get screwed.\n\nSorry fired up and had to get that out.",

Que _half an hour_ of the phone being handed from person to person and each of them awkwardly trying to avoid saying anything to me because they could not find anyone on duty who was authorized to give me the at that point painfully obvious news, until they finally gave up _and told me to call back later_. I hung up, went out to dinner with friends, came home and collapsed and then woke up early the next morning to a phone call from my father's Rabbi shouting at me to immediately give him my father's body.
