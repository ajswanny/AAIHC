{"body":{"0":"One of the most interesting sentences to me, and one that holds great logical and philosophical (and clearly legal) weight:\n\n> Precedent protects the right of a married couple not to procreate, so the right to marry cannot be conditioned on the capacity or commitment to procreate.\n\nThe last sentence on page 3, from [the PDF of the majority decision published on the SC website](http:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/14pdf\/14-556_3204.pdf).","2":"And gays across the country who have been relying on \"Hey, I'd love to get married, but it's not legal\" woke up to a *really* awkward conversation. ","3":"I've been using the whole \"I won't get married until the gays can\" excuse with my girlfriend.\n\nGentleman, it's been a privilege playing with you. ","5":"My Facebook will never be the same after this week. I'm going to buy stock in popcorn and butter, y'all. ","7":"I've seen a lot of people ask how the Supreme Court has the authority to decide this issue for states. For those interested, I am an American lawyer and I can answer that question with some insight.\n\nYes, the Supreme Court does have the authority to make sweeping decisions that invalidate any and all state laws which conflict with its ruling. The Supreme Court finds this authority in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and from the very significant court case of *Marybury vs. Madison* which more or less established the Supreme Court's absolute authority to literally \"say what the law is.\"\n\nStates do have autonomy to decide certain issues for themselves. These are judicial notions of 'comity' and 'parity,' the idea that state governments are better equipped to deal with local and regional issues rather than a distant Congress in Washington. In fact, the laws of contracts traditionally belong to states, which is why every state in the U.S. has slight legal differences in how contracts are formed, enforced, written, etc. Marriage, in its most basic legal form, is a contract entered into by two consenting adults, which is why marriage laws have been decided by state legislatures and state courts.\n\nBut there's an important amendment to the U.S. Constitution that (as of today) strips away the right of a state to define marriage in their laws as a union between one man and one woman: the Fourteenth Amendment (and more specifically the Equal Protection Clause) which states:\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \nWithout getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to the issue of marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?\n\nTo that question the Supreme Court has apparently said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says *a lot*. The Court is literally saying there is no rational relationship between banning same-sex marriage and protecting marriage. Thus, same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and every such law in the United States is immediately invalidated.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made sweeping judgments like this before, although decisions of this magnitude are quite rare. For examples, see *Brown vs. Board of Education* (which held that state laws enacting racial segregation were unconstitutional) and *Loving vs. Virginia* (which held that state laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional).\n\nTL;DR: Yes, the Supreme Court has the authority to say what the law is for the entire nation. Yes, marriage is traditionally an area kept to state law, but only up to a limit until a law runs headlong into the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Important Edit:** It appears I've disseminated some amount of disinformation for which I apologize (I did not get around to actually reading the full opinion until now). As pointed out to me by \/u\/Armonster20, the Supreme Court **DID NOT** review this case under rational basis. Rather, it was decided under a strict scrutiny review. The majority opinion does not even make much mention at all of the words \"sexual orientation,\" instead focusing on the fundamental right of marriage. A lot of you have asked about the varying standards of review, but I must confess that constitutional law is outside my usual day-to-day practice and I'm doing the best I can to remember the basics I learned in law school. I could try to explain the standards of review in detail but I'm afraid of saying something inaccurate. The least I can do is direct you **[here](http:\/\/blogs.findlaw.com\/law_and_life\/2014\/01\/challenging-laws-3-levels-of-scrutiny-explained.html)**.\n\nBut to go into just a little more detail, the strict scrutiny test is the most demanding standard of review to which the Supreme Court can subject a law. The reason the Supreme Court chose to review this case under this very exacting test is quite logical actually: the Supreme Court has previously said that any law that abridges a \"fundamental right\" must meet the most demanding scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has previously deemed the right to marry as a fundamental right. Thus, because any state law that excludes an entire class of people from participating in marriage obviously implicates the fundamental right to marry, we get strict scrutiny. (FYI - Another fundamental right under the Constitution is the right to have an abortion.)\n\nWhat this means is that the majority made it damn-near impossible for the respondents (i.e., the states defending their same-sex marriage bans) to win in this case. What this does NOT mean is that any future LGBT issues will be given the same standard review, unless they of course deal with marriage. Most likely, any future litigation on LGBT issues will be subject to rational basis review or something that's informally been called \"rational basis review with a bite\"--a standard somewhere between normal rational basis and intermediate scrutiny.","8":"That's it, my wife and I are getting a divorce.","10":"This is destroying the sanctity of Bristol Palin's marriage.\n\nEDIT: more gold pls","11":"RIP pastor in texas who said he would light himself on fire when this day came..","13":"The final two paragraphs of the Court's opinion:\n\n> No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies\nthe highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,\nand family.

The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.  When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed\n\n> * Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. \n\n> * No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\n\n**Highlights from the Roberts Dissent**\n\n> * When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are--in the tradition of our political culture--reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. ... But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds. People denied a voice are less likely to accept the ruling of a court on an issue that does not seem to be the sort of thing courts usually decide.\n\n> * If you are among the many Americans--of whatever sexual orientation--who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.\n\n**Highlights from the Scalia Dissent**\n\n> * This is a naked judicial claim to legislative--indeed, super-legislative--power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government.\n\n> * But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today's judicial Putsch.\n\n> * If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\" I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\n\n**Highlights from the Alito Dissent**\n\n> * By imposing its own views on the entire country, the majority facilitates the marginalization of the many Americans who have traditional ideas.

The fundamental\nright to marry does not include a right to make\na State change its definition of marriage. And a State's\ndecision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has\npersisted in every culture throughout human history can\nhardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does\nnot enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a\nState are free to expand marriage to include same-sex\ncouples, or to retain the historic definition.\n\n> Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step\nof ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex\nmarriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I\nbegrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe\nin a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach\nis deeply disheartening.

In addition, it's harder for someone to be a casual beekeeper. It used to be you could have a hive in your backyard and just kind of ignore it for the most part, and that just doesn't work anymore.

This dairy farmer in this thread though is what farmers should be, he sounds like the real deal, and dairy farmers are unique anyway. The few that I've known have been good people. But the corn\/soybean\/pig farmers I've known are far more common and not what people imagine farmers to be. \n\nThose people burn all of their garbage because they're too cheap to pay for a dumpster service. Drive around rural Iowa and you'll regularly see giant plumes of black smoke from farmers burning old tires rather than lay to dispose of them. They receive millions in farm subsidies and tax breaks, yet vote Republican because they don't like paying taxes for \"welfare.\" \n\nThey drive their heavy damaging equipment on roads they don't pay for because they use untaxed fuel. \n\nFuel economy is less efficient for all and food is more expensive for all because in Iowa the law requires corn ethanol be blended into gasoline. Corn ethanol uses as much if not more energy to produce energy and since its food it drives up food prices, and it's less efficient so it hurts MPGs. \n\nThey dump and spray chemicals that leach into water supplies. They have ruined countless small waterways due to greedy crop planting too close to water and through bad livestock management. I could go on and on. \n\nFarmers who care about nature and do the right thing by their livestock and society are too rare now and should be celebrated.

Hybrid Theory and Meteora carried me through some dark times in my youth. \n\nThe one lasting memory is putting Meteora in my mini hifi and writing a suicide note to my parents, telling them to play Breaking the Habit and Numb to understand why I killed myself. \n\nI put Breaking the Habit on and lay in the bath with a big, sharp knife in my hand. I started singing the lyrics to myself and decided to wait until the song was done to cut myself. \n\nAt that moment, halfway through the song my dad knocked on the door. He never came to my cottage (in my parents' backyard). He came in and asked me if something was bothering me and that I should talk to them. He didn't know what I was about to do. So we sat and listened to the album as I talked to him.\n\nRIP Chester, and thanks for everything you meant to me.  ","1915":"Hybrid Theory was the first album that got me into that sort of music.

Around the same time, Linkin Park's 'A Thousand Suns' came out, featuring songs like 'Waiting For The End' and 'The Catalyst' that really spoke to me.  The inner booklet [described how the album was a study of human emotion, and how 'change is born in our most harrowing moments'](http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/_YJM766qf5ps\/TN68YEQwZ7I\/AAAAAAAAMRM\/8mE_31RQNI0\/s1600\/Booklet-2.jpg), and for the first time in a long time my perspective on my situation began to change.

RIP Chester.","1929":"I'm Asian, so I never talk about my feelings because it's a bad holdover from how I was raised.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was walled in by strict christian Asian parents who dictated my life. I was only to have christian friends. I was to win at everything. A loss, to them, was only possible if I did not have faith in god and was therefore a wicked child who didn't try hard enough. If god could part the red sea, surely I could become the national champion in six different things at once. I became the state chess, debate and science fair champion, made it to all state in violin, and one tier below the professional orchestra at NEC. They didn't even go to my state debate champion awards ceremony. I remember standing alone outside waiting to be picked up while the second and even fifth place winners walked out with their happy parents. I cried, and when my father took me home he beat me for crying. I got straight As, I got a perfect score on the PSAT and a 2360 on the SAT. I took every single AP class at once and even took all of Harvard's undergraduate curriculum for biology while still in high school. It didn't matter. Nothing was ever good enough for them. Success wasn't to be rewarded. It was expected. The only time my father ever told me he was proud of me was when I got into caltech, which was immediately followed by his profound disappointment that I did not get into Harvard. I was only allowed to listen to classical music and was not allowed to hang out with other kids except christian kids and only on special occasions during christian potlucks. We only wore khaki pants and polo shirts, with the pants pulled up very high so we didn't look like \"gangsters with saggy jeans\". Dating was forbidden, and any sexual confusion was just ignored and treated like a mysterious evil curse. \n\nBecause my grandfather was both a pastor and military policeman with old ROC values, my father was just as strict and frugal. We had descended from the \"Dragon\" family line of generals stretching far back into history. We were to assemble at attention in a line instantly when called within 10 seconds or be beaten. No heat on the coldest nights and no air conditioning on the hottest days. Showers should only take 1 minute. We were not allowed to have food preferences. All food had been graciously provided by god, they said. He would buy clothes too big for us meant to last ten years. No TV. No celebrations on sinful american holidays. We were to forgo earthly needs, because \"man did not live on bread alone.\" Often, dinner consisted of a $1 hot dog wrapped in a kraft cheese single with one piece of white bread and a slice of lettuce. We ate rice gruel often. To this day I have a preference for super cheap food, like eating plain rice with just soy sauce and sesame oil. Because he didn't believe in women's rights or birth control, my mother kept having children. I had 4 other siblings. This made us very poor. Sometimes all we had to eat were saltines and condiments that we took from the free section of wendy's. We lived in a barn infested with bugs and were the poorest kids in town. I remember one time I asked my mother if we could give a friend a ride two blocks down and she screamed at me and then broke down in tears, saying we were running out of gas for the month and that my dad had to get to work. When things finally did get better, my dad said he would buy us an xbox if we could beat him in chess. When we beat him, he said instead that we had to win a tournament. When we finally got the console, he made us play The Bible Game on it, banned most violent games, and play DDR to exercise but only on songs that he approved of.\n\nBecause god had let the Israelites wander for 40 years as punishment until every person older than 18 died, my parents took that to mean that children weren't considered humans yet who could really make judgements they could be held accountable for. They basically thought we had no human rights of our own. My family made Tiger Mom look like Barney.\n\nBecause I had almost died when I was two months old to pneumonia, my parents had declared me a sacrifice to god, a Nazirite, if I were to survive. \"You are a priest forever, in the name of Melchizedek\", they told me. My life was not my own, because I had already died and this new life belonged to god. They named me Long Zhan in Chinese, meaning Dragon Warrior, and Genesis in english. I was to wear the armor of god and wage holy war against Satan. Ironically it basically meant my names were Genesis and Revelation, since revelation is often known as the dragon war. Which meant they named me Alpha and Omega, or god.\n\nOne day I stumbled upon a book in my father's study, where he kept his books from college. I read Nietzche's Beyond Good And Evil, thinking it was a christian book. When I finished reading it, everything changed. The things he said made too much sense for me to ignore.\n\nTHERE IS NO GOD kept flashing in my mind. I couldn't ignore it. I tried to force myself to believe in god and become christian again but it didn't work. I tried praying, but god wasn't there.\n\nI hid my new beliefs. I knew what would happen if my parents, who often told me that a wicked child should be stoned to death, found out. They often said they would rather kill me with their bare hands than raise an atheist.\n\nIt came to a head one day in middle school when I couldn't deal with a meaningless life anymore. I snuck away during worship and hid under a staircase, repeating to myself in shock \"what's the point?\"\n\nMy friend Katherine found me there. She understood. She was also dealing with hidden depression. We sat in our misery for hours. Before that moment, it seemed everyone was in paradise. That they were the dancing figures on the walls in Plato's cave that I was once a part of. It seemed all of them faced forward and that somehow I had looked backwards and found the void of nothingness behind their paradise that nobody else saw. But when I asked her what we could do, she didn't know how to answer either. We were blind leading the blind.\n\nToday I know this feeling isn't rare and that I wasn't alone. But because I was so isolated by christian rules, I didn't know of anything else in the world. I didn't know that the somber \"why bother\" of nihilism could be interpreted as the adventurous \"why not?\" I was an echo chamber of my own dark thoughts, with no-one to guide me. The only wise people were philosophers I read after Nietzche like Kant, and they were all dead. They couldn't talk to me. It was a long time before I would ever discover Nagel and Camus or the freedom of absurdism. Everyone I knew was christian. We had spent years shunning non-christians and the world outside my bubble was classified under a ubiquitous fog of war.\n\nWhen my father found me under the stairs he yelled at me for embarrassing him in the church and beat me when I got home. Slowly, they began to suspect that I was no longer christian. I remember making armor out of cardboard and wood in secret to protect against my father's blows. I remember making a runaway kit.  I remember running for my life up into the attic to keep my mother from killing me with a kitchen knife and calling the police while holding the door shut with my feet as she clawed at it. I remember fighting my father with a chair and cooking pot when he came for me with a metal bat.\n\nA friend of mine sent me the song Numb. I know that song saved me. It finally told me that someone else out there had dealt with this and come out with this beautiful song. It told me that the veneer of constant serenity of christianity I had forgotten I had even put up was a farce, that sometimes it was okay to be upset and mad and to punch a wall and let out all of these feelings instead of letting them eat me up. That it was preferable to feel anything, even bad things, instead of nothing, because then I valued the good more. The sonorific screams cut through my numbness.\n\nI remember sneaking up at 5am at night to play Morrowind to deal with stress while listening to Meteora on my cd player in secret and all the candy bars I had to sell at school to buy new batteries. I remember how when I entered portal temples Easier To Run would somehow always play as the sun rose outside my window, like it was telling me someday I would be free. To this day that song still pops up in my mind unbidden every time the sun rises. I listened to that CD player until it stopped spinning. I remember how I danced to Faint and went wild so I wouldn't be ignored anymore, how I longed for Somewhere I Belong and my heart soared when the ghostly echo of \"heal\" sounded. I remember being inspired to draw gothic art of monsters by Papercut, and how my mother poured oil on it and threw it in the trash. Years later when my sister took art lessons, I snuck something I drew to her teacher. He told me I had more talent than my sister did, said it to my mother's face. And my sister won the congressional national competition and her art is hanging in capitol hill. He made my sister use my other art pieces as the basis for her next few pieces, that I had given to my friend Annette in a folder so that it wouldn't be found in my house.\n\nToday, I'm a scientist and a breakdancer with zero signs of depression. I pushed through despite my parents not supporting my desire to be a biologist because they didn't believe in evolution, or thinking that breakdancing was just something that homeless black gangsters did while rolling around dirty floors. I taught myself bioinformatics in the kitchen, did research by hand that others did on computers or in the lab. I learned to do dangerous moves on concrete. Linkin Park saved my life. I have never cared for celebrity news before but somehow I am genuinely sad at Chester's passing because this man who saved me had no one to save him and I feel almost guilty.","1930":"Everyone's fighting a battle you know nothing about.

I hope my fiance and Chester have found  the peace they desperately had been searching for.. I don't know why I'm sitting here crying. Chester's death is bringing up memories that I had thought time had buried. I was just a young mom back then.. Now my children are grown and I'm a grandma. Just breaks my heart.

This post is kind of a mess because I was trying to find information about this show while I wrote it and I kept going back and adding information.  Sorry about that.\n\nSo, I met these guys right before the release of Hybrid Theory.  They were an opening act...\n\n...I can't think of who the headliner was though...Found it!  Looks like I was there to see Twiztid and Kottonmouth Kings - no wonder I couldn't really remember that part of the show.  I was going though a juggalo phase, think of that what you will.  Oh yeah, ReHab was there and at that time they were this corny rap group who actually had strippers that toured with them.  Same songs, but they sounded completely different.\n\nRight - they were opening that tour (I don't think anyone was there to see them, in fact) at a little club in Winston Salem, NC:  Ziggy's.  It's closed now but they used to have some amazing shows.  I saw acts from Hank Williams III to Deftones to Weezer to ICP there, it was a really kind of \"close\" space - just about anywhere you were, it felt like you could reach out and touch the people on stage.\n\n...or at least get fully doused in Faygo\n\nAnyway, their show - this would have been around mid-to-late 1999 (found it!  Looking through setlist.fm - it was September 18th, 2000) was just amazing, partly because of the venue but largely because of their performance.\n\nThere couldn't have been more than a couple of dozen people in the place for their show, but it was probably one of the tightest live performances I've *ever* seen - and I've helped run sound for acts like MDC, Jucifer, Skeleton Witch, and plenty of others - not to mention the shows I've attended as an audience member.\n\nThe guitar player wore headphones.  I've never seen anyone else do that.  The \"DJ\" didn't just do the record-scratching that it seemed all other rap-rock-metal-alternative-Bizkit-bands did around then.  He was live-sampling and mixing the levels of the other members on stage.  The synergy between them was on another level.  The live sound was pretty much album-quality, but it was right *there*...\n\nI told them as much after the show.  They were humble, gracious, and extremely nice.  I told them straight up:  You guys are going to be selling out arenas before too much longer.  I'm paraphrasing here, but Chester said something like \"that would be amazing, but I don't really think so.  We've been doing this kind of thing for a while now and we just love going around and playing for people who are into the music.\"  It seemed like they weren't thinking \"what does the radio want, how can we sell a hundred million records?\" - they were more like \"this is what we sound like when we do what we love, enjoy it with us.\n\nChester and Mike signed two demo tapes for me.  I've still got them.  Besides tshirts, posters, and other random merch that I've been given by bands who I've booked or done stage work for, I don't really have any other \"memorabilia\" - just those two tapes.  I stopped paying attention to them well over a decade ago.  I just wasn't into the sound anymore, to be honest - tastes change.  I still think the first record is brilliant, and the second record is pretty great too - those songs will always remind me of my early years in the Marines.  Someone was almost always blasting one of those CDs during field day.\n\nI mopped so many floors to those tracks.\n\nI wish he hadn't gone so soon.  He was full of music, and poetry.  Maybe it was a bit on-the-nose, a bit too much angst...too much anger, resentment, and other vague but passionate feelings towards an undefined \"you.\"  Some might say that's simplistic, formulaic - but it allows for the listener to place themselves in the narrative of the song, and recognize the things that they're feeling - and know by extension that they're not alone.  As an angsty young guy with too many hormones and too little life experience, it was very therapeutic sometimes to just turn the volume up and scream along.  I know I'm not alone in this either - I've seen you doing the same thing when I drive by you in traffic, don't try to deny it.\n\nIt's just a shame that the man who wrote those words couldn't find the same solace in them that they conveyed to so many others.\n\nI could close this out with almost any couple of lines from one of their songs, but I don't want to pick just one.  So go hit up YouTube, dig deep into your mp3 library, or even dust off an old CD and play a song or two for yourself...and enjoy the music.  That's what he told me was most important, and I think that's the kind of farewell he would have wanted.","1941":"Time is a valuable thing\n\nWatch it fly by as the pendulum swings\n\nWatch it count down to the end of the day\n\nThe clock ticks life away\n\nIt's so unreal","1943":"I've struggled with depression since I was not even a teenager.

Within a couple of years, I had mostly moved away from that sound, but I've never lost an appreciation for LP.

Music has always played a huge role in my life, but never more than when I was first in recovery. I listened to Linkin Park SO MUCH early on, because both the words and Chester's expression of them totally represented all the anger, confusion, conflict, hopelessness AND hope that I felt. Faint, Numb, Somewhere I Belong, Breaking the Habit, Crawling, Runaway...Oh, man. Knowing that he had his own battle with addiction is one of the things that made him so authentic.

It was one of the first times I was really introduced to nu-metal that I liked and I remember being so excited about the album coming out. I bought it day one and listened to it over and over again. That blossomed into my adoration of all different genres of metal, which got me into playing musical instruments. Playing music gave me a greater respect for the talent that goes into ALL genres of music and really broadened my horizon for what I listen to.

Over the years, I have never lost faith in them or hated them. The only album I haven't loved is The Hunting Party. I adore every other main album of theirs for various reasons.\n\nI fucking LOVE One More Light. The band was never, ever afraid of exploring and trying new sounds. Sell outs? Nah, they morphed their music as they grew as people, and appropriately so.\n\nQuick story: my father was arrested for some real shit when I was in high school, and my family's perfect little suburban Americana life was irrevocably upended. This was soon after Meteora came out, and in my deep depression of immediate post-father-arrest, I became severely attached to the song Breaking the Habit. I would play it on repeat for days and days on my speakers, with my bedroom's door shut and locked (the key to open it always available on the door frame, of course - house rules). My poor mother was worried sick about my intentions, obviously. Back then, I wasn't even considering harming myself, but in retrospect it's completely understandable why she thought so, especially with that song. But goddamnit it helped me cope, and that song is the single most important song in my entire life, and a complete demonstration of how music can heal.\n\nWriting this post has reduced me to tears, and they aren't manly tears, they are pure tears of sadness and pain.

Man, this year is brutal.","1966":"The 14-year-old me just died.","1968":"A little late to this, but it's imperative to remember that while Chester Bennington's suicide is tragic, he was also a survivor of repeated sexual abuse as a child from ages 7-13. He bravely battled depression, body dysmorphia, shame, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts for nearly 30 years; and chose to channel that trauma and anger into his art - something I could certainly relate to (and admire) in my early adolescence. It was rare for \"Hybrid Theory\" to leave my CD player when I was 14\/15. I felt less alone when I listened to that album. I felt understood. I skated to it. Linkin Park - along with Blink 182, NIN, and Marilyn Manson were much more the sound\/a phase of my youth than Sound Garden, or Nirvana.\n\nWhen I look at Chester's life, the life of a tormented artist - who's effort was often ridiculed by people (including myself in my mid-twenties) who don't make anything other than critiques and criticisms - similar to Van Gogh, and David Foster Wallace (who also took their own lives) I am reminded of when I attempted to hang myself, in treatment, when I was nearly 26 years old - and ripped the lighting fixture out of the ceiling. I am reminded of the letter I had written my mother that stated \"I swear to God I tried\", congruent with Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo - in which he wrote \"The sadness will last forever\".\n\nI think about how absolutely (for lack of a better word) *fucked* my life felt after overdosing, getting kicked out of grad school, and finding myself over 40k in debt. Stripped of the only coping mechanism (oxycontin) I had that worked at staving off the torment of just trying to survive. But when I thought I hit bottom, it started hitting back - and I know, from experience (I've broken a lot of bones), that there is no bruise like the bruise that loneliness kicks into your spine. Shame has an uncanny ability to warp\/destroy any healthy perspective of ourselves, and our ability to be loved. It's like a shattered mirror. I thought that there was something inherently wrong with me - that I was broken\/damaged - and that perspective dictated my behavior.\n\nA common misconception about \"why\" people chose to take their own lives is that they are \"weak\" or \"troubled\". And that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTo quote David Foster Wallace on the subject:\n\n> The so-called \"psychotically depressed\" person who tries to kill his\/herself doesn't do so out of quote \"hopelessness\" or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill themselves the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.\n\n> Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \"Don't!\" and \"Hang on!\", can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\n\n\nHaving felt those flames - and making that choice to jump, I know (now - almost 7 years later) that it was definitively the wrong choice to make. I wasn't aware of any other option. I didn't know that if I asked for help - I wouldn't just learn how to fight those flames - people would meet me in them. I was terrified that if I was honest about how I felt, and what I thought about daily - that I'd end up in drooling in the corner of a padded room - pumped full of so many anti-psychotics that I wouldn't even respond to my own name. But what I was really afraid of was feeling the weight of everything. Of beauty, darkness, and trauma. I couldn't imagine, much less live in a world that wasn't curbed by something.\n\nThese days I'm not plagued, I still have intrusive thoughts, but I promise, it does get better. I got better because I got (and continue to get) the professional help I need(ed). I feel the weight of everything, in it's entirety, and it is more than enough. \n\nI am no longer sick, **I am infected with the tremendous excitement of living, because I believe that I have the strength to bear it. I believe that you do as well.**\n\nSo if you struggle with depression, substance abuse, and\/or suicidal thoughts I want you to know you are not alone. I know that there is hope because I carry it with me. And I'm not going to yell up from the street asking you to hold on. I'll meet you in the flames every time they rise.\n\nAnd I know there is a chance that the worst day may still be coming, so let me say for the record \"I'm still going to be here, asking the world to dance - even if it keeps stepping on my holy feet\".\n\nFriend, if all we have to gain in staying is each other - My God that is plenty. My God, that is enough.\n\nThat is so, so much for the light to give.\n\nPS: Please consider giving a donation to https:\/\/www.rainn.org in Chester's Memory.","1970":"I never really liked Linkin Park all that much. \n\nBut I remember Numb.

Thanks to my love of Linkin Park I connected with a girl I met online, who I ended up dating for 3 and a half years and almost marrying. She introduced me to other bands like Coheed and Cambria and AC\/DC, which inspired me to pick up a guitar.

Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993.\n\n>\"He was the premier guy in the business,\" says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. \"He was our Michelangelo.\"\n\n>Over the next decade, drawing on the tactics he honed working for Nixon, he helped elect two more conservative presidents, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. At the time, Reagan was beginning to exhibit what his son Ron now describes as early signs of Alzheimer's, and his age and acuity were becoming a central issue in the campaign.\n\n>But in 1993 Ailes inked a secret deal with tobacco giants Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to go full-force after the Clinton administration on its central policy objective: health care reform.\n\n>Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting \"real people affected by taxes.\"\n\n>According to internal memos, Ailes also explored how Philip Morris could create a phony front group called the \"Coalition for Fair Funding of Health Care\" to deploy the same kind of \"independent\" ads that produced Willie Horton. In a precursor to the modern Tea Party, Ailes conspired with the tobacco companies to unleash angry phone calls on Congress - cold-calling smokers and patching them through to the switchboards on Capitol Hill - and to gin up the appearance of a grassroots uprising, busing 17,000 tobacco employees to the White House for a mass demonstration. \"RJR has trained 200 people to call in to shows,\" a March 1993 memo revealed. \"A packet has gone to Limbaugh.

Only a few days before Trump's Inauguration and The Review's anniversary event, Thiel attended the pro-Trump and heavily alt-right-attended \"Deploraball,\" which had been in part organized by Jeff Giesea '97, a former Review editor-in-chief who once worked at Thiel Capital Management.\n\n>In Oct. 2016, shortly after Thiel donated $1.25 million to Trump, Thiel publicly apologized for passages in his 1995 book The Diversity Myth, such as claiming that some alleged date rapes were \"seductions that are later regretted,\" ... But three months later, during the after party of the 30-year anniversary event at Thiel's home, according to a former editor, Thiel stated that his apology was just for the media, and that \"sometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/stanfordpolitics.org\/2017\/11\/27\/peter-thiel-cover-story\/\n\nAnother area where Republican voters get so easily played by billionaires using \"God, guns, gays\" and racism to get less regulation and avoid paying their taxes:\n\n>Exhibit 13: 10% fewer Republicans believed the wealthy weren't paying enough in taxes once a billionaire became their president.

We're protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them. Head over to http:\/\/www.verizonprotests.com\/ for more info.\n\nAlso there is a March on DC at https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marchfornetneutrality\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we're planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\nWHAT'S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nWHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we're shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\nWHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we're calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai's plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\nHOW CAN I JOIN? Click here http:\/\/www.verizonprotests.com\/ and you'll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one, and we'll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can't attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.\n\n","3224":"They won't let me get a passport.

According to the Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House is in line to become President after the Vice President--true.  However, there are strong arguments that the Succession Act is unconstitutional.  It all hinges on the definition of the word \"officer.\"  In the Constitution, \"Officer\" is a term of art that most plausibly should be interpreted as an \"Officer of the United States,\" which in and of itself is a specific term with a very specific meaning.  What's pertinent is that the Speaker of the House is not, under this definition, an Officer of the United States.  \n\nIf it ever came down to it, and the Speaker was actually going to become President, it's almost guaranteed that the opposing party would file suit in the SCOTUS, and there's a strong case to be made that the SCOTUS should strike that language from the Act.  \n\nFor a more detailed background, see [this](http:\/\/digitalcommons.law.yale.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1959&context=fss_papers) article in the *Stanford Law Review*.  \n\nEDIT: Someone made a good point below that whether the opposing party would file suit is more a function of whether it'd be politically expedient.  I.e. maybe they'd prefer the Speaker to be the President over the officer next in line.  I agree with this.  \n\nEDIT2: Someone else made a good point that other parties aside from the opposing political party might have standing to challenge the Succession Act.  Sounds like a plausible scenario.  ","3779":"Democrats need to start partitions for ranked choice voting in primaries in their individual states. \n\nStart on the local level and work up.

Buddy of mine lived in an apartment in the San Fernando Valley and this old lady who lived next door used to ask my friend to buy her groceries. She'd pay him $100 just to get her a couple of items. What stuck out to me was that she'd hand him a money order to get the stuff. I have never even seen a money order, so I don't know how one can use it to buy groceries. Turns out, that lady was Bettie Page. Once a week, Hefner would have his driver pick her up so they could hang out at his mansion and watch movies and shit. One day, she invited my friend and I to go with her. Hefner seemed nice. The mansion was pretty empty, though. It wasn't like naked women were randomly walking around or anything. After about 45 minutes, he asked his driver to take me and my friend back to his apartment. My friend was a bit disappointed we couldn't stay longer. I was just happy to meet Hugh Hefner.\n\nOn another note, my buddy ended up having to tell Ms. Page that he couldn't get her groceries anymore.

At the time, I was a virulent feminist and the Playboy building was in Chicago where I lived. I saw Hef standing at his residence in Chicago at that time . He was a short guy, holding a martini in front of his Gold Coast home. I was always appalled back then , and if you were a woman back then you threw your anger at guys like Hefner and other men who you thought were misogynistic fellows. Well, I mellowed with time, and I think of all of the great articles and brilliant essays that Playboy printed, and my feelings towards Hef and his magazine became more comical and I left that stage of anger to recognize the magazine as a terrific mouthpiece for the civil rights movement at the time, and the forum for writers and artists to show their ideas. I.E., I stopped disliking Hefner and saw him as just a person who had grown up, as I had, in the repressed 1950s, when it was taboo to be so many things. His porn is mild and silly to me now, and I recognize, despite his weirdness for dressing women as rabbits, his contributions to the world of literary brilliance. He published things no one would publish at the time. Believe me, you had to live in the 50s to see how daring his magazine was...including the porn, which now merely looks to me like any catalogue for Victoria's Secret.  So, well, good journey to you , Hef. Thanks for the articles. Yep , I bought your magazine for the articles...for real...signed, Grandmother now and former angry little feminist. Now I just laugh at my former self and hope all your rabbit ladies had good pension plans. Salut!","3887":"It's funny. In the age of the Internet, with more hard core porn available than anyone could possibly hope for, Hef and Playboy seem pure and innocent in comparison. \n\nBack in the day, when I was in grade school, a Playboy magazine was the Holy Grail.

If you know anything about Linda's story, she was horribly abused and forced into prostitution by her scum bag boyfriend. Deep Throat made millions and she made a few hundred dollars. Her boyfriend forced her to do a dog porno at gunpoint. And when they went to the mansion for a party after Deep Throat came out, her boyfriend told Hugh Hefner about how he could get a dog to have sex with her. I guess he was extremely eager and into it, so he brought them to a room where him and the boyfriend watched as they attempted to get the dog to have sex with Linda. At this point Linda had learned to scare the dog off in a subtle way, so that her boyfriend wouldn't beat her after. I don't know who provided the dog, but it was at the mansion and I doubt they brought a dog to his party. \n\nThe other part that creeped me out about Hugh is that he wouldn't let the Holly, Kendra, and Bridget leave to see their families like ever. The families had to come there. I recall one of them saying they weren't allowed to leave for a family trip. And when they left the mansion they had to tell security where they were going and it was recorded. They also had curfews every day. I remember the girls had to do a trip to Vegas in one episode and I just remember them being really nervous about getting back on time.

But Playboy, I think, lost some of it's bite when the libertarianism that had been essential to securing a voice for the magazine was no longer important to it.

A couple minutes later, same thing all over again. \n\nMy uncle passed away in June. My dad did try to tell her once or twice but she just didn't react at all... at least, not outwardly. At that point, she stopped eating. She was admitted to the hospital. At one point, she said my uncle's name and then said something about him never really eating well or being in poor health. Something like that. So something did click on some level. She continued to decline. It was hard to see her begging to be brought home - not to her home where she lived for over 60 years... she wanted to go to where she lived as a teen. That was home to her. When we arrived for a visit, she also yelled at my dad for leaving her there without any clothes. She didn't understand why she was there, why she was in a hospital gown, and why she couldn't go home. The last time I saw her, she was begging for someone to help her. It was awful.\n\nFor me, I feel like one of the worst things about everything was her mental decline. My grandmother was always healthy, active, and liked to keep her mind sharp.

And I don't particularly care for fish.","4474":"They adapt just fine, they do have specific dietary requirements, environmental considerations (imagine an intelligent four-year-old equivalent feathery dog armed with a built-in pair of scissors that can reach just about every location and can't be potty trained) and need a great deal of input.\n\nVery rewarding though.\n\n*They said as the bird sticks their beak in my face for the three hundredth time tonight.","4476":"Oh my god I fucking hate swap meet and flea market pet stores because they make me so sad. Yeah the cages are cheap and big and probably the only thing I'd buy, but I would NOT want to support them if their parrots look like that. They all look sad or depressed or mentally angry with a lot of pulled feathers or broken beaks. One of the saddest I saw was a toucan who was missing the front portion of their upper bill and he was just hitting his cage walls over and over with his beak. In fact his beak was dull looking and his coat was matted and unglossy. I've seen pet toucans before and when properly cared for they are fantastic birds (Thank you Magnolia Bird Farm in Riverside!) Their coats are nice and shiny, their beaks are vibrant, and their behavior is playful with constantly jumping around their cages, flying places with a passion, and playfully bitting at your hands and fingers in a soft manner. It just...made me sad.","4478":"As someone with a pet bird that I love dearly, I agree. Sometimes I wish birds had never been adopted as pets.\n\nPractically, though, there are so many older birds with no ability to live in the wild for a whole lot of reasons. Their owners die and there are no friends or relatives willing to take them in, they are poorly socialized and their owners get rid of them, they bond to one person and attack all others and their owners get rid of them, their veterinary care is ridiculously expensive and their owners get rid of them, the owners realize that pet birds bite and scream at ear piercing volumes and require constant attention and get rid of them. \n\nFor these reasons I would LOVE to see bird ownership restricted to adoption and have breeding phased out. When I adopted my guy I had to do a certain number of volunteer hours at the rescue (so worth it, and a really brilliant requirement), they did multiple interviews and at least two home visits and I spent a lot of time interacting with the birds under supervision to make sure that the bird and I were good matches for each other.","4480":"Do you know if this is true for the whole state?  I live in the DFW area and haven't seen a pet store in any mall around here for at least a decade.","4482":"A legal precedent and legal definition would have to be set on what is and isn't a \"mill\", and once a definition is set they could just change once aspect of their operation, and bam: legally protected loop hole.\n\nSadly people are fucked up and will always find a way around it, and unless the legal definition is carefully worded it could open the doors to litigation against legitimate ethical breeders or even farmers.\n\nLaws will eventually be passed, but they might not be enough, as with any law, there needs to be long well-thought-out considerations.","4483":"That's not CA's call. The mills aren't in CA. They're in Missouri, Mississippi, Kansas, etc. They're not going to outlaw them because they're part of the culture and economy there. So this is CA's only option.","4485":"As a Californian, we do a lot right but we do a lot wrong as well. ","4487":"Wow, it's almost like Government HELPS people! \/s","4489":"I work in animal rescue. The dogs in mills aren't ever going to be pet store stock. They are breeding animals and they are frequently ugly. Mill owners don't care if their ears get infected, their toes drop off from the wire floors of their cages, their legs break, their fur falls out, their teeth fall out or anything else that doesn't endanger their lives or endanger their ability to produce litter after litter of cute puppies. \n\nWhen a mill goes under or the animals are no longer useful, the animals are auctioned off to other mills or killed. Frequently with a gun or other cheap method. Sometimes rescues buy the dogs from the auctions. The mill owners don't care who buys the dogs, it's all money in their pockets so they don't discourage rescues from buying the animals. In fact, rescue bidding against other mill operators drives the price of the dog up so the mills sometimes actually start breeding for rescue. \n\nIf the USDA shuts down a mill the dogs are confiscated and taken in by various animal welfare groups. Sometimes shelters, sometimes rescue, sometimes both. It's a huge burden for the groups dealing with the influx of dogs because they are all in very poor health and frequently they've never been handled except harshly. They are sometimes very difficult to bring around and getting them to a place where they can be a family member instead of a terrorized and terrified creature can take years. \n\nIt's heartbreaking but the breeding stock in a mill look more like gargoyles than like dogs. If you have a strong stomach google it. But I warn you, it'll break your heart and you'll never look at a pet store puppy again without seeing the image of its suffering mother still in the mill.

They're the best of dogs and cats without the bad parts :)","4494":"Here's the thing about chickens: you can't raise hens for eggs without, uhh... liquidating? all the male chicks.\n\nThis is not callousness or a humanitarian thing. I quit most meat years ago and simply don't run into the rest anyway. Might as well be vegetarian.\n\nBut roosters do not coexist. Certainly not in groups of any size.\n\nIf we want eggs, we need hens. Hens have a relatively short working life, so we need to let them hatch once in a while, and half of the chicks will be male.\n\nI don't really know what to do about that *except* to eat the males, feed them to a dog, etc., any of which would beat the callous solution your disgusting local meat farm employs: on a conveyor belt into a grinder and dead.","4496":"I am in an area that was affected by Hurricane Irma, and I was told we couldn't bring rabbits to the pet friendly evacuation shelters. I was shocked because I would never leave my rabbit at home just as someone else would never leave their dog or cat.

","4498":"Pet shops might be able to source some puppies from backyard breeders, but there's no way they can get the volume of puppies they need without puppy mills. Pretty much by definition, a reputable breeder is one who screens potential owners closely and will take the dog back if the placement doesn't work. That model just doesn't work for pet shops. And without puppy mills, they can't keep up with fads in dog breeds, like all the people who want husky puppies after watching Game of Thrones. \n\nI live in a place that passed a law like this a while ago, and pet stores just stopped selling dogs and cats for a profit. The big chain stores made agreements with local shelters to display available shelter cats and host dog-adoption events, but the animals still belong to the shelter until adopted. The store makes money on it because they can sell a bunch of toys and accessories to the adopter and pitch their grooming and training services. The smaller stores that primarily sold puppies and kittens either closed down or switched to a \"small animals and pet supplies\" business model. ","4500":"This is true. Not all animals can make companions. \n\nYou're going to get a lot of hate from radicals, but, yes I think most people avoid shelters because they don't want to inherit someone else's problem pet.

He literally spent the first 9 years of his life in a filthy cage. As a result of the abuse he has spinal issues, weak legs, and a broken sphincter, meaning he shits the bed every night. He would have been killed pretty quickly at a shelter, but now he will be able to live out his days among our pets, treated like one of the family. He never had dog toys before coming to our house, and is only now learning how to play a little bit. He loves sleeping with his stuffed ducky, and despite everything he's suffered through at the hands of humans, he's a super gentle and loving dog.

They are the most loving, docile pets ever. Almost like dogs, they won't leave me alone when I'm home. It's like they know you rescued them.  ","4512":"If they try to mark up the prices on the pets, people will just get them at the shelter and the store will lose money because they have to pay to feed and house the animals.\n\nAnd pets from the shelter almost never have \"papers\" to artificially jack the price up. They are just \"dogs\" or \"cats.\"\n","4513":"\"Artisanal, organic cats and dogs, raised by dudes with well trimmed beards and flannel...\"","4515":"After a decade of the mills not producing more pets, I'd assume the supply to dwindle.","4517":"No. Pet stores in CA already do things this way - this isn't new. California pet stores (at least, any that I have seen all over the state, it could be different in some areas that I haven't been to but I've been to a lot of them) already don't sell mill puppies\/kittens. They already have agreements with rescues and shelters. The adoption fees are the same as from the rescue\/shelter - the store doesn't profit off the adoption. It benefits the pet store because then the person adopting the animal buys the new pet supplies at the pet store since they are already there. ","4519":"That's not a bad thing. ","4521":"I haven't seen dogs or cats sold in pet stores in years, you find birds, snakes, rodents, but not the big 2. I didn't know it was still legal anyway.","4522":"No, pet stores in CA already do this. Shelters and rescues set up agreements with pet stores and it works out well for everyone. The pet stores see it as their way of appearing charitable, and they benefit because the people who adopt the pets then go buy the supplies in the store. The cost of the pet is the same as it would cost to adopt directly from the shelter or the rescue. The pet stores don't profit off the adoption.","4524":"Shitty breeders are just as likely to produce aggressive dogs. It can be bred in.\n\nGood breeders don't do this. If they do they aren't good breeders.\n\nAnd with shelters, you kind of do know what you are getting if the shelter is doing a half decent job of screening the dogs. My local shelter and rescues mostly use foster homes so they have a pretty good idea of how dogs will actually act in a real home.","4525":"I have worked in dog rescue for a long time and I want to clarify that a lot is really the extreme minority. We have seen literally thousands of animals over the years at my current shelter and very few have serious issues. Most are dogs that come from homes that have been abandoned because someone dies or someone gets a boyfriend or someone moves or someone gets a puppy and a 5 year old dog isn't cute anymore. We also get tons upon tons of puppies-just oodles of them, all the time, who do not have serious issues either.

","4529":"does nothing to stop someone from getting a dog from a breeder, just they won't be going to a retail environment.

They cycle them around and evenly distribute them. The petshops have no say in which animals end up in their shops. Source: I volunteered with a shelter that had a program in place, they were the ones who decided based on temperament\/health. The petshops didn't have anything to do with the day to day operations, really. Its not like they bought the cats from the shelter and then sold them, they had nothing to do with the adoptions. ","4534":"In my opinion it seems like they would make more money now. Shelter animals are next to free while I imagine buying from a mill costs much more money. ","4536":"Respectable Breeders like to screen their owners. ","4538":"After 30+ years of having rescue cats (some from shelters, some from the streets), I figured I'd get a purebred cat.

Not that you're saying this, just for education purposes. Most good breeders want to screen potential adopters even going so far as doing home visits, criminal and reference checks. Most good breeders wouldn't consider selling an animal to anyone without those checks. If a breeder is willing to ship you a dog just on the qualification that you have a credit card, they're probably a mill with a convincing website.

Many animals common in the pet trade don't breed in captivity, or at the very least we don't know how to breed them yet. The simple answer would be disallowing these animals, but if you follow forums- as I do- you'll actually find enthusiasts actually helping the scientific community learn how to reproduce them in captivity. Also, periodically adding wild caught specimens into current pet industry breeders leads to greater genetic diversity which reduces the chance for inbreeding, and keeps the captive population healthier long term.

I going to give my good boy a hug now :(.","4664":"shelters are more like a holding area for unwanted animals. They generally don't have the time and resources to sit on animals until \"the one\" comes along, let alone purchase\/bid for them. They don't create a demand because they are a service for their respective area-- for the animals that cannot be accomodated by private citizens. They accept adoption fees to cover their costs, but they don't specifically go looking for animals to rescue, they just deal with what is dealt upon them.\n\nRescues tend to operate very differently.","4666":"The answer to this is really nuanced because sometimes you will hear people excuse buying a mill dog from a pet shop as 'saving' it. And they are, but the issue is that as long as the dogs can be sold legally, the puppy mills are going to keep operating regardless of what the end purchaser does. It costs most of these places almost no money to run the mills because they don't care about the dogs. The pet stores sell the puppies for a stupid high mark-up like $500, when it costs the mill maybe $15 through the lifetime of a bitch to take care of it. THey'd keep going even if the dogs sold for $30.\n\nWhen one end of the business is so unscrupulous, it doesn't matter what anyone else does. Buy, don't buy, send it to a shelter, they do not give a rats' butt.\n\nSo people and shelters are helping the mills but only because they want to help the dogs, and helping the dogs in that case is more important. The only way mills are actually going to be fully shut down is through legislation like in the OP. Not only does this prevent pet stores from buying the dogs, but it also gives animal welfare groups more leverage to start busting these operations and prosecuting the owners. There are some states that most mills operate out of that have almost no animal cruelty laws which is why they operate with no issues. We need to start making changes at the top, the legal level, so that it can reach the bottom and finally deprive the mills of the means to keep operating.\n\nSo yeah. If you want to help stop seeing lots of dogs in shelters, petition your state reps for laws like this. That's the only way we can cut off the head of the beast.","4668":"Well, mostly they sell puppies to pet stores. They don't sell breeding stock unless they are liquidating stock or getting out of a particular breed of dog. Most breeding stock live out their miserable lives in the mill. In horrific conditions. ","4670":"Yeah, but it's my understanding that they euthanize adoptable ones too.","4672":"Yeah, that makes sense to me.  My kitty is a girl that I got from a rescue last year.  She's always wanting to check everything out in the mornings (gotta open the closets and closed doors), get some pets and play time in before I go to work.  It's funny how cats like routine (or seem to anyway).","4674":"We found Annie in a bush, hiding from a larger, meaner cat at 6 weeks. She's the sweetest little bundle of fur, and she follows you around until you pet her. \n\nWe have two others, both of which are awesome.

Long story short, they were both female and both got pregnant at the same time and gave birth to two litters on the same day. I now have 8 cats. Who are all spayed and neutered.  Now to catch the neighborhood tramp and get her fixed too so she can stop making super cute adorable little dwarf cats :s","4678":"That's how we got our Kitties at Petco. The shelter was there and our cats found us.","4680":"Right, we don't have an overpopulation problem when it comes to healthy, young, attractive pets. We have an \"overpopulation\" problem when it comes to people dumping older pets and pets with behavior problems. Our shelter has been no-kill for a while without any kind of agenda to do so simply because their adoption rate is really high. So really the problem is irresponsible pet owners, not supply and demand. \n\nPeople who really want a puppy or kitten of a certain type can still go to a private breeder.","4682":"And they're ridiculously expensive. My local pet store sells puppies for a minimum of $1000, purebred kittens for ~$1000, and RESCUE cats for at least $400. You can go get a kitten from a shelter for about $50. Not to mention the puppies are likely inbred and will suffer tons of diseases. ","4684":"Some areas do mostly have pit bulls and chihuahua.\n\n\n\nIn my area breed specific rescues take in most of the other breeds, and people may consider them less accessible because their criteria for families may be beyond \"suitable\". If I could get a rescue of the breed I was looking for in a pet store instead of having a busybody old lady critique my life I think I would be more likely to adopt though. \n\n\nI looked into adopting a KC spaniel or mix, and the two closest to me wouldn't adopt to young adults, childless couples, or families with young children. They also had a bunch of rules on housing location and yard spaces. Not everyone is in the right place to adopt, but some of the rules with breed specific rescues are well beyond basic care and welfare. A lady at the local humane society offered to contact me before contacting a breed rescue, which I appreciated.

Yikes. If judging a place based on stereotypes alone isn't shallow, I'm not sure what is. For what it's worth, I've lived outside of CA too and didn't find people elsewhere to be any more or less shallow.\n\nEven among liberals, CA politics (until recently) have generally been dismissed as crazy and not something to be taken seriously. Meanwhile, conservatives frequently refer to the state as a \"failed state\" despite the fact that it never \"failed\" and is doing extremely well economically. My personal favorite was when Rick Santorum claimed that UCLA is so anti-American that it doesn't offer a single American history class; I had to take two as a graduation requirement.\n\nFrom what I hear, people in Oregon and Washington are quite open about their hatred of Californians, since so many are moving to find better real estate prices. At least that almost makes sense, although I don't understand extending the hatred to Californians who haven't moved north.\n\nJust in general, I hear\/see far more negative references to California than positive ones, and most of those positive statements come from Californians. It seems like most of this is due to political propaganda and people generally buying into stereotypes about Californians.","4718":"California is the poster state for anti-liberal statements from conservative media.

Not necessarily.

The president was going to have a press release to reveal this info.\n\nImagine Press Group A. PG A wants to report the facts, and also spin this info in Suzie's favor. They would report \"Suzie eats apple, throws benefit for the poor.\" (This is a true statement).\n\n PG A has intentionally worded their news to make Suzie look better, and bolster the Pro-Suzie side of the argument.\n\nImagine Press Group B. PG B wants to report the facts only. They would report \"Suzie eats apple\". \n\nPG B did not spin this info either way, supports neither side. \n\nImagine Press Group C. PG C wants to report the facts, and also spin this against Suzie. They would report \"Suzie eats apple, spends 100k on private estate.\" (This is a true statement) \n\nPG C has intentionally worded their news to make Suzie look worse, and bolster the Anti-Suzie side of the argument.\n\nImagine Press Group D. PG D wants to *dystroy* Suzie. They're looking for a fight, not a conversation. They don't really care about \"facts\"- if they can get people to believe it, they'll print it. They would report \"Suzie throws apple at homeless man, spends 100k on kicking puppies\" (This is an outright lie- the only truth in their statement is that Suzie at one point was holding an apple. )\n\nPG D has intentionally written sensationalist nonsense in order to dupe and rile up people against Suzie.  They did not show the parts of the truth that suited them- rather, they invented a new truth that suited them. This is what's known as alternative facts, or as it's more commonly recognized, pure bullshit. \n\nNow, the President is the one releasing this info. Say the President strongly supports\/ is in the pockets of \/would greatly benefit from supporting PG D, and what they stand for. And so, when holding this press conference, he only allows PG D inside.\n\nNow, and here's the really important part, so pay attention:\n \n**The only image that we, the citizens, get to see of Suzie is the one the President agrees with.**\n\nThis is no longer a matter of supporting or not supporting a controversial ideal. This is a deliberate manipulation of the 'truths' released to the public, and is a disservice to every American citizen, reguardless if they agree with the topic or disagree with the topic at hand. The President should not get to decide what version of the truth the people get to see. They should not get to censor the argument by only allowing the people they agree with to report on it, end of story. \n\nThis is a disgrace.\n\nEdit: added to the top","4854":"Given that every single word the administration speaks at press conferences is a lie, this will probably help CNN provide more honest reporting of the President.

Now the government has tanks, drones, invisibility suits, robot soldiers, bombers, nukes, fighter jets, warships, satellites, microwave guns, etc. Thanks to the same people who fear our government voting for politicians who make government too militarily powerful. (The boogieman enemy of my boogieman enemy is my boogieman friend) \n\nBut the guns are a distraction from the reality. Every single leap ahead in liberty came from the people standing and loudly demanding change: from freeing the slaves, to black people voting, women voting, 18-21 voting, civil rights, ending Prohibition, ending segregation, legalizing weed in certain states, labor laws, environmental protection, etc, etc. \n\nThe guns myth-power against government served to distract from our true power.
